1. EAR tends to spike when blink occurs. Can be shown using scatter plot
2. By testing several times, we can determine the natural EAR 
using statistics (MEAN, MEDIAN, MODE).
3. Determine the FPS the camera runs to know the threshold for blink duration.
4. How to implement head position when it only gets the coordinates?
5. Machine learning algorithm for face detection can detect really far.
6. It can only detect up to a certain head tilt.
